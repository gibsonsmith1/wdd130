        <h2>This is A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello! My name is Gibson and I am a computer science major. 
            I love to be outside and to hang out with my friends! I am an avid runner and have been for many years.

        <h2>Religion</h2>
            <p>
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life. 
            My favorite verse in the Book of Mormon is in Ether, chapter 4 verse 7.
